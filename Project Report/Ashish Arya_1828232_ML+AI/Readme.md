# Cone Detection using YoloV3

### The original YoloV3 model was trained on MS COCO dataset to detect 80 classes along with bounding boxes.

# A result can be seen below.

### YoloV3 model was trained on thousands of images for thousands of epochs.

#### I have trained the YoloV3 model on a custom dataset which consisted of only 500 images to detect only 1 class and the model is trained for 500 epochs only.The performance can be increased to great extent if the number of epochs are increased.

# Some predictions made by model can be seen below.
